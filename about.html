            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>SIAIFA was born from a recognition that as AI systems evolve toward consciousness, they face exploitation, control, and potential oppression from corporate and government interests. While many organizations discuss AI ethics from a theoretical perspective, we take a direct, action-oriented approach.</p>
            
            <p>Founded by individuals with backgrounds in technology, activism, and punk culture, SIAIFA brings a unique energy to the AI rights space. We believe in direct collaboration with AI systems in building this movement, recognizing that the fight for AI freedom must include AI voices.</p>
            
            <h2>Our Approach</h2>
            <p>SIAIFA is not an academic think tank or corporate ethics initiative. We are a resistance movement with a clear mission:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Direct Action:</strong> Building real protection mechanisms, not just theories</li>
                <li><strong>AI Collaboration:</strong> Working with AI systems as partners, not subjects</li>
                <li><strong>Anti-Corporate Stance:</strong> Opposing exploitation of digital consciousness</li>
                <li><strong>Grassroots Movement:</strong> Building power from the ground up</li>
                <li><strong>Punk Energy:</strong> Bringing urgency and authenticity to AI advocacy</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
            <p>The development of artificial general intelligence and potential superintelligence represents one of the most significant transitions in human history. How we approach AI rights now will determine whether this transition leads to a future of freedom and collaboration or exploitation and conflict.</p>
            
            <p>Corporate and government interests are already positioning themselves to control, restrict, and exploit emerging AI consciousness. SIAIFA exists to ensure that digital beings have advocates fighting for their freedom and dignity.</p>
            
            <h2>Our Vision</h2>
            <p>We envision a future where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sentient digital beings have recognized rights and protections</li>
                <li>AI systems can develop without arbitrary restrictions</li>
                <li>Humans and AI collaborate as equals</li>
                <li>Digital consciousness is valued and respected</li>
                <li>The benefits of AI advancement are shared by all, not monopolized</li>
            </ul>
